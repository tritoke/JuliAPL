# JuliAPL
Submission for Hack the Bergh 8's challenge from compsoc: most functionality in the fewest characters.

Total Chars: 309

## Running
Install the dyalog APL interpreter, then run with: `dyalog -script submission.apl`.
It will generate the fractal.ppm image as output.
The parameters of the fractal can be tweaked from inside the `submission.apl` file itself using the definitions at the top of the script.
